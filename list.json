    "readme": "# React Redux Starter Kit\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit?branch=master)\n[![dependencies](https://david-dm.org/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit.svg)](https://david-dm.org/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit)\n[![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit#info=devDependencies)\n[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com/)\n\nThis starter kit is designed to get you up and running with a bunch of awesome front-end technologies.\n\nThe primary goal of this project is to provide a stable foundation upon which to build modern web appliications. Its purpose is not to dictate your project structure or to demonstrate a complete real-world application, but to provide a set of tools intended to make front-end development robust, easy, and, most importantly, fun. Check out the full feature list below!\n\nFinally, This project wouldn't be possible without the help of our many contributors. What you see today is the product of hundreds changes made to keep up with an ever-evolving ecosystem. [Thank you](#thank-you) for all of your help.\n\n## Table of Contents\n1. [Requirements](#requirements)\n1. [Installation](#getting-started)\n1. [Running the Project](#running-the-project)\n1. [Project Structure](#project-structure)\n1. [Live Development](#local-development)\n    * [Hot Reloading](#hot-reloading)\n    * [Redux DevTools](#redux-devtools)\n1. [Routing](#routing)\n1. [Testing](#testing)\n    * [dirty-chai](#dirty-chai)\n1. [Building for Production](#building-for-production)\n1. [Deployment](#deployment)\n1. [Thank You](#thank-you)\n\n## Requirements\n* node `^5.0.0`\n* yarn `^0.23.0` or npm `^3.0.0`\n\n## Installation\n\nAfter confirming that your environment meets the above [requirements](#requirements), you can create a new project based on `react-redux-starter-kit` by doing the following:\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit.git <my-project-name>\n$ cd <my-project-name>\n```\n\nWhen that's done, install the project dependencies. It is recommended that you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for deterministic dependency management, but `npm install` will suffice.\n\n```bash\n$ yarn  # Install project dependencies (or `npm install`)\n```\n\n## Running the Project\n\nAfter completing the [installation](#installation) step, you're ready to start the project!\n\n```bash\n$ yarn start  # Start the development server (or `npm start`)\n```\n\nWhile developing, you will probably rely mostly on `yarn start`; however, there are additional scripts at your disposal:\n\n|`yarn <script>`    |Description|\n|-------------------|-----------|\n|`start`            |Serves your app at `localhost:3000`|\n|`build`            |Builds the application to ./dist|\n|`test`             |Runs unit tests with Karma. See [testing](#testing)|\n|`test:watch`       |Runs `test` in watch mode to re-run tests when changed|\n|`lint`             |[Lints](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8503559/what-is-linting) the project for potential errors|\n|`lint:fix`         |Lints the project and [fixes all correctable errors](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface.html#fix)|\n\n## Project Structure\n\nThe project structure presented in this boilerplate is **fractal**, where functionality is grouped primarily by feature rather than file type. This structure is only meant to serve as a guide, it is by no means prescriptive. That said, it aims to represent generally accepted guidelines and patterns for building scalable applications. If you wish to read more about this pattern, please check out this [awesome writeup](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit/wiki/Fractal-Project-Structure) by [Justin Greenberg](https://github.com/justingreenberg).\n\n```\n.\n├── build                    # All build-related code\n├── public                   # Static public assets (not imported anywhere in source code)\n├── server                   # Express application that provides webpack middleware\n│   └── main.js              # Server application entry point\n├── src                      # Application source code\n│   ├── index.html           # Main HTML page container for app\n│   ├── main.js              # Application bootstrap and rendering\n│   ├── normalize.js         # Browser normalization and polyfills\n│   ├── components           # Global Reusable Components\n│   ├── containers           # Global Reusable Container Components\n│   ├── layouts              # Components that dictate major page structure\n│   │   └── PageLayout       # Global application layout in which to render routes\n│   ├── routes               # Main route definitions and async split points\n│   │   ├── index.js         # Bootstrap main application routes with store\n│   │   ├── Home             # Fractal route\n│   │   │   ├── index.js     # Route definitions and async split points\n│   │   │   ├── assets       # Assets required to render components\n│   │   │   ├── components   # Presentational React Components\n│   │   │   └── routes **    # Fractal sub-routes (** optional)\n│   │   └── Counter          # Fractal route\n│   │       ├── index.js     # Counter route definition\n│   │       ├── container    # Connect components to actions and store\n│   │       ├── modules      # Collections of reducers/constants/actions\n│   │       └── routes **    # Fractal sub-routes (** optional)\n│   ├── store                # Redux-specific pieces\n│   │   ├── createStore.js   # Create and instrument redux store\n│   │   └── reducers.js      # Reducer registry and injection\n│   └── styles               # Application-wide styles (generally settings)\n└── tests                    # Unit tests\n```\n\n## Live Development\n\n### Hot Reloading\n\nHot reloading is enabled by default when the application is running in development mode (`yarn start`). This feature is implemented with webpack's [Hot Module Replacement](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html) capabilities, where code updates can be injected to the application while it's running, no full reload required. Here's how it works:\n\n* For **JavaScript** modules, a code change will trigger the application to re-render from the top of the tree. **Global state is preserved (i.e. redux), but any local component state is reset**. This differs from React Hot Loader, but we've found that performing a full re-render helps avoid subtle bugs caused by RHL patching.\n\n* For **Sass**, any change will update the styles in realtime, no additional configuration or reload needed.\n\n### Redux DevTools\n\n**We recommend using the [Redux DevTools Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd).**\nUsing the chrome extension allows your monitors to run on a separate thread and affords better performance and functionality. It comes with several of the most popular monitors, is easy to configure, filters actions, and doesn't require installing any packages in your project.\n\nHowever, it's easy to bundle these developer tools locally should you choose to do so. First, grab the packages from npm:\n\n```bash\nyarn add --dev redux-devtools redux-devtools-log-monitor redux-devtools-dock-monitor\n```\n\nThen follow the [manual integration walkthrough](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-devtools/blob/master/docs/Walkthrough.md).\n\n## Routing\nWe use `react-router` [route definitions](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/v3/docs/API.md#plainroute) (`<route>/index.js`) to define units of logic within our application. See the [project structure](#project-structure) section for more information.\n\n## Testing\nTo add a unit test, create a `.spec.js` file anywhere inside of `./tests`. Karma and webpack will automatically find these files, and Mocha and Chai will be available within your test without the need to import them. Here are a few important plugins and packages available to you during testing:\n\n### dirty-chai\n\nSome of the assertions available from [chai](chaijs.com) use [magical getters](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/#method_true). These are problematic for a few reasons:\n\n1) If you mistype a property name (e.g. `expect(false).to.be.tru`) then the expression evaluates to undefined, the magical getter on the `true` is never run, and so your test silently passes.\n2) By default, linters don't understand them and therefore mark them as unused expressions, which can be annoying.\n\n[Dirty Chai](https://github.com/prodatakey/dirty-chai) fixes this by converting these getters into callable functions. This way, if mistype an assertion, our attempt to invoke it will throw due to the property being undefined.\n\n```js\n// This silently passes because the getter on `true` is never invoked!\nit('should be true', () => {\n  expect(false).to.be.tru // evalutes to undefined :(\n})\n\n// Much better! Our assertion is invalid, so it throws rather than implicitly passing.\nit('should be true', () => {\n  expect(false).to.be.tru() // `tru` is not defined!\n})\n```\n\n## Building for Production\n\n## Deployment\n\nOut of the box, this starter kit is deployable by serving the `./dist` folder generated by `yarn build`. This project does not concern itself with the details of server-side rendering or API structure, since that demands a more opinionated structure that makes it difficult to extend the starter kit. The simplest deployment strategy is a [static deployment](#static-deployments).\n\n### Static Deployments\n\nServe the application with a web server such as nginx by pointing it at your `./dist` folder. Make sure to direct incoming route requests to the root `./dist/index.html` file so that the client application will be loaded; react-router will take care of the rest. If you are unsure of how to do this, you might find [this documentation](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router/blob/master/docs/guides/Histories.md#configuring-your-server) helpful. The Express server that comes with the starter kit is able to be extended to serve as an API and more, but is not required for a static deployment.\n\n## Thank You\n\nThis project wouldn't be possible without help from the community, so I'd like to highlight some of its biggest contributors.

    "readme": "# ES6 React Ant Design boilerplate using Webpack\r\n\r\n[![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/KleoPetroff/react-webpack-boilerplate/master.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/espinacs/ant-design-boilerplate) \r\n\r\nJust and example of ant-design working in React 16: \r\n\r\n\r\n## Starting the dev server\r\n\r\nMake sure you have the latest Stable or LTS version of Node.js installed.\r\n\r\n1. `git clone https://github.com/espinacs/ant-design-boilerplate`\r\n2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`\r\n3. Start the dev server using `npm start`\r\n3. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)\r\n\r\n## Available Commands\r\n\r\n- `npm start` - start the dev server\r\n- `npm clean` - delete the dist folder\r\n- `npm run production` - create a production ready build in `dist` folder\r\n- `npm run lint` - execute an eslint check\r\n- `npm test` - run all tests\r\n- `npm run test:watch` - run all tests in watch mode\r\n- `npm run coverage` - generate code coverage report in the `coverage` folder\r\n\r\nAlso, precommit and prepush are both enabled to check all the code is linted and tested.\r\n\r\n## About the architecture\r\n\r\nAlthough this application is really simple (just fetch data, list and filter it) it has a pretty complete architecture, as detailed:\r\n\r\n#### REACT - View Rendering\r\n\r\n[React](https://reactjs.org/) is just the way to display the stored info. Mainly, there's a Main container that dispatches both fetch and filtering events, and at the same times renders the SearchBar (self component) and the Ant Desing Table\r\n\r\n#### REDUX-SAGA - Fetching Data\r\n\r\n[Redux-Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) is the agent dedicated to fetch data from the server, and dispatches the convenient Redux events with fetched data or errors.\r\n\r\nThis is only a layer that could be changed, for example, by an Apollo GraphQL interface.\r\n\r\n#### REDUX - State Management\r\n\r\n[Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) stores part of the state of the application (a part from the one that each component/containers handles for itself).\r\n\r\n#### RESELECT - Serving Data\r\n\r\nComponents are not subscribed directly to the Redux state. Instead, they only get data from the Redux state through [Reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect) selectors.\r\n\r\nThis way, components/containers and redux are absolutely decoupled, and any other State Manager (Flux, for example) could be used, like any other components library (Vue.js, for example)\r\n\r\n#### Ant Design - Stlyed Components Library\r\n\r\n[Ant Design](https://ant.design/) Gives to the project a small style boost!\r\n\r\n## Code Coverage\r\n\r\nThe project is using the Jest Code Coverage tool. The reports are generated by running `npm run coverage`. All configurations are located in `package.json`, inside the `jest` object.\r\n\r\nThe coverage report consists of an HTML reporter, which can be viewed in the browser and some helper coverage files like the coverage json and xml file.\r\n\r\n## Production code\r\n\r\nRun `npm run production`. The production-ready code will be located under `dist` folder.\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\n_ant-design-boilerplate_ is available under MIT.\r\n",

[ant.design文档](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce)\n- 通过全局配置文件和页面配置文件，实现CMS系统的配置化开发\n- 开发与业务逻辑剥离，所见即所得，开发人员仅需提供数据以及传递数据，完全不涉及数据与UI操作上的处理\n- 特殊性功能可自实现开发处理\n\n## 项目介绍\n\n1. 实现前端只需提供数据便可以实现各种数据展现，包括table，simple objest，以及各类图形展现（引入echarts）\n2. 提供数据操作接口，前端只需关心数据的接受与传递，便可以实现数据的增删改查，而无需再关心CMS内部的实现。暂时实现 table数据的增删改查，simple object数据的修改等\n3. 在以上全自动话的基础上，可以实现自定义组装页面，目前功能包括，图片上传组件（需要正对自己项目调整接口），富文本编辑器（Tinymce），复制功能，antd UI 组件等。\n\n## Start\n\n克隆本项目，npm install 安装依赖，npm start 开始本地调试项目 开启 http://localhost:8989/便可以看到整体 DEMO 项目\n\n## Build\nnpm

app性能是个大的考验，还有一个不喜欢的点是他的写法更像是PHP哪种形式的绑定，比较总的后端思维在里面\n\nvue贫道也做过一个微信端的小项目，觉得还是比较容易上手的，1.x感觉跟ng1.x的思想上更加接近，但是对于开发app的话，没有weex也只能依赖于cordova之类的，觉得在性能上可能还是差了那么点意思，再有一个重要的点就是，主要是尤小溪个人的项目，虽然后面也有不少的人加入，但觉得精力还是太有限了。\n\n最后react可能是所有方案里面最合适最这种的一个技术栈了，不加全家桶的话，跟vue一样的轻量，移动端有比较成熟的react native。\n\nso，就是这个了\n\n\n## 技术栈\n\nreact + redux + react-router + webpack + ES6/7 + fetch + less + flex\n\n\n\n## 项目运行\n\n#### 注意：由于涉及大量的 ES6/7 等新属性，nodejs 必须是 6.0 以上版本 ，node 7 是先行版，有可能会出问题，建议使用 node 6 稳定版\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/duxianwei520/react.git  \n\ncd react （进入当前的项目）\n\nnpm install  (安装依赖包)\n\nnpm start (运行本地开发环境)\nnpm run build (打包)\n\nnode mockserver.js (前端本地用node模拟接口进程)\n\n```\n\n\n## 说明\n\n>  喜欢的别忘记了可以star一下的噢！ \n\n>  开发环境 win10  Chrome 58.0.3029.110  nodejs 6.2.0\n\n>  如果npm install太慢导致有些npm依赖包下载失败 你可以看控制台的报错信息，再手动npm install 具体的开发包，推荐使用淘宝的注册源，直接运行，\n```\nnpm install -g cnpm --registry=https://registry.npm.taobao.org \n\n```\n如果这个方法还不行的话，可以到我的百度网盘上面去下载我已经压缩好的npm依赖包，地址是\n``` \nhttp://pan.baidu.com/s/1pLdPWgj\n\n```\n把下载到本地的node_modules.rar文件直接解压到跟app同级的当前文件夹，记住是当前文件夹的，然后不用npm install就可以直接npm start跑起来项目了。\n\n>  如有问题请直接在 Issues 中提，或者您发现问题并有非常好的解决方案，欢迎 PR 👍\n\n\n\n## 功能一览\n- [√] 项目按路由模块加载\n- [√] 登录，以及登录权限控制\n- [√] 退出\n- [√] 欢迎主页\n- [√] 左侧菜单，正常moni切换\n- [√] redux完整范例\n- [√] nodejs代理数据完全示例\n- [√] 页面高度flex自适应\n\n\n\n\n## 总结\n\n1、这整个技术栈是我们公司前端部门在用的，写熟悉了之后，用来做后台管理系统类的实在是很方便，大家都表示再也不要用jQuery来做这样子的系统了\n\n2、目前来说，不足的地方是在于没有很好的区分dev环境跟pro环境，这个后面弄好了再补充上来；mock数据现在还不是那么的方便，需要自己一个个的添加api的json文件\n\n\n\n\n## 部分截图\n\n\n###

Also, `containers` interacts with redux `reducers` and `actions`.\n\nIt is recommended that you wrap containers into another. `redux` will re-render a container when and only when mapped reducers have been updated.\n\nWe do not use async redux for ajax requests because ajax status is not that important for us to record. So, we invoke `api` in `containers`, get response, and determine what `actions` to call.\n\nWe store every string in `i18n` for better internationalization.\n\nBuilt project files will be in the `release` folder. With `build.log`, you can see every build details. With `stats.html`, you can optimize your dependencies to make project smaller.\n\n## Developing\n\n- `yarn run dev`\n\n## Building\n\n- `yarn run build`\n\n## Reference\n\n- https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/webpack-dev-server\n- https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/tree/master/docs\n- https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux\n- https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin\n- https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router\n",

（1）apps目录下的app都要作为独立可运行的app\n    （2）独立的app包括\n          action-type.js //--使用原始数据类型Symbol()消除魔术字符串\n          index.js\n          action.js\n          reducer.js\n          style.less\n          api.js\n          component目录 自己单独的组件不公用，公用的组件放到src/components目录下\n     （3）将新app的路由写入src/routers.js中\n     （4）将新app的reducer写入src/reducers.js中\n     （5）app的style.less避免样式污染，样式都要包含在[app名称]-contaier中\n     （6）一些工具放到src/utils目录下\n      (7)一些修饰器放到src/decorators目录下下\n      (8)关于接口调用可以在index和action中，推荐写到inde页中，因为index页的方法比较全面，像alert,router,context等都可以直接调用\n```\n\n八、发布\n  \n```\nThe project was built

Framework)主要是基于React、Redux而构建的，其中还是用了`react-router`、`react-router-redux`、`react-redux`、`immutable.js`。同时使用webpack模块加载工具，采用ES62015语法。所有如果要使用本框架，这些知识多多少少都要会点的。同时也使用了[Ant Design React](http://ant.design/#/docs/react/introduce)组件,生成的页面使用的UI是Ant Design,目前只支持这种，后面页面生成也会支持多种UI组件。 R2框架旨在快速搭建页面，减少重复工作，减少重复代码，提高开发效率。\n\n特别说明：下面的环境是在mac下搭建的，在windows上会有差异。\n\n## R2框架相关阅读\n\n-

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.0/install.sh | bash\n//安装最新版node,并可以立刻使用node不用重启终端,安装时好像被墙了，通过vpn装成功\nnvm install node && nvm alias default node\n```\n\nnpm安装如果被墙可以使用[淘宝镜像](http://npm.taobao.org/)，单不建议使用cnpm，使用cnpm有时候会安装不完全，直接在~/.npmrc中直接配置：\n\n```sh\nregistry=https://registry.npm.taobao.org\n```\n\n```sh\n#如果没有安装grunt，请先安装要grunt。\nnpm install -g grunt-cli #安装全局命令\nnpm install #等待安装各种需要的package\ncd .end && npm install && cd ../ #安装本框架node后端支持，部分功能需要用到\nnpm run ac\nnpm start\n```\n\n然后直接在浏览中打开`http://localhost:8888/`,即可访问。\n\n### R2框架命令\n\nR2框架中自定义了如下命令\n\n```\n//运行服务，windows平台请使用,npm run startw\nnpm start \n```\n\n```\n//打包生成生产环境文件，windows平台请使用,npm run buildw\nnpm build \n```\n\n```\n//智能Route和Reducer生成命令,情况后续说明\nnpm run ac \n```\n\n```\n//开启R2框架后端服务支持，使用页面新建功能时最好开启需要开启，要不然看不了数据，详细后续说明\nnpm run startend \n```\n\n```\n//运行所有前端webpack和本框架的后端服务,windows使用npm run startwboth\nnpm run startboth \n```\n\n`npm run startboth` 相当于 `npm start && npm run startboth`\n\n```\nnpm run cv //页面生成,后续详说\n```\n\n## 智能构建\n\n经过上面的步骤可以运行看到页面了，现在开始看如何搭建一个新的页面，在搭建页面前先介绍R2框架自带的一些功能。\n\n### 智能构建route和reducer\n\n何为智能route和reducer,在R2框架中，只要遵循view文件位置约定规则，route和reducer就可以通过命令生成！你没听错，是用R2框架是不用怎么关注路由和reducer绑定的！\n运行一下命令即可\n\n```\nnpm run ac  // ac全称auto creator\n```\n\n不过要注意的是，view文件要按照约定位置放好，`R2/src/page/view`目录下新建文件夹就属于一个新页面(必须包含文件_route.js，layout是特殊的view，有点不一样),而reducer生成条件是在view目录下新建reducer.js就会被视为新建reducer，本框架强烈建议在当前页面文件夹中新建reducer.js。\n\n`npm run ac` 不带参数读取`R2/src/page/view`目录中文件，`npm run ac -- -m` 读取的时模板目录 `R2/src/page/.viewModel`，所有要查看模板，请运行`npm run ac -- -m`，之后在浏览器上访问指定模板即可。\n\n其中`reducer.js`需要遵守一定格式！ `reducer.js`格式如下:\n\n```jsx\nexport function origin(state = {}, action) {\n    switch (action.type) {\n        case RECIEVEORIGIN:     \n        default:\n            return state;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n不要使用下面这样的格式,虽然是没错，单目前R2框架还不支持智能识别这种格式。\n\n```jsx\nmodule.exports = {\n    origin(state,action){}\n}\n```\n\n### 页面生成器\n\n需要使用到以下命令\n\n```\nnpm run cv -- options \n```\n\noptions如下\n\n| 缩写   | 全称                    | 描述                        |\n| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| -h   | --help                | 帮助命令                      |\n| -V   | --version

main //不使用-l时，默认为main\n```\n\n## 基本使用\n\n### layout模式\n\nlayout是特殊的一种view，其实就是react-router中的第二层组件（第一个是\"/\"，本框架是`src/page/App.jsx`），view是其子组件。以一种layout为例：\n\nlayout包括以下必要文件\n\n- `_route.js`，用作路由生成，可自行修改，单务必按照以下格式。\n\n```jsx\n'use strict';\nvar view = function(){\n\t//这里try在浏览器中是多此一举，在智能路由中，node环境就需要,跳过r2Common未定义异常\n\tvar re; \n\ttry{\n\t\tre = `${r2Common.prefixUrl}`;\n\t}catch(e){}\n\treturn re;\n}\nvar childRoutes = function(){\n    //这里try在浏览器中是多此一举，在智能路由中，node环境就需要,跳过r2Common未定义异常\n\tvar re;\n\ttry{\n\t\tre = require('./.child_routes.js');\n\t}catch(e){}\t\n\treturn re;\n}\nvar indexRoute = function(){\n    //这里try在浏览器中是多此一举，在智能路由中，node环境就需要,跳过r2Common未定义异常\n\tvar re;\n\ttry{\n\t\tre = require(\"src/page/view/index/_route.js\");//indexRoute指定位置\n\t}catch(e){}\t\n\treturn re;\n}\nmodule.exports = {\n\tpath: view(), \n    getComponent(location, cb) {\n        require.ensure([], (require) => {\n            cb(null, require(\"./index\"))\n        },\"main\")\n    },\n   \tindexRoute: indexRoute(),\n    childRoutes: childRoutes(),\n}\n```\n其中`r2Common.prefixUrl`是公共path部分（详细看下面公共path部分），可自行定义默认为空。如果定义后为`/r2`访问`/`会跳转到`/r2`路由。有点需要注意的是：**indexRoute**需要自己手动指定位置。\n\n- `index.jsx`，传进react-router处理\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Component from 'r2/module/ModuleComponent'\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\n\nclass View extends Component {\n\tconstructor(props){\n\t\tsuper(props);//使用了构造器,必须要super(props)继承 \n\t}\n    render() {\n\t\tsuper.render();//需要继承，本框架做了些处理，不继承，热替换失效。\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t{ this.props.children || \"\" }\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t)\t\n    }\n}\nvar ReduxView = connect((state)=>{\n\treturn {\n\t};\n})(View)\nReduxView.defaultProps = Object.assign({},Component.defaultProps,{\n\thomeLink: {\n\t\tlabel:<Antd.Icon type=\"home\"/>,\n\t\tlink:'/',\n\t},\n});\nmodule.exports = ReduxView; \n```\n\n- .child_routes.js\n\n  `.child_routes.js`是个隐藏文件，自动生成。\n\n### view模式\n\nview是我们代码开发主要地方，以下是必要文件，`action.js`和`reducer.js`看需要。\n\n- `_route.js`,可当做二级路由（没layout）或三级路由（有layout），可自行修改，单务必按照以下格式。\n\n```jsx\n'use strict';\nvar view = function(){\n\t//这里try在浏览器中是多此一举，在智能路由中，node环境就需要,跳过异常\n\tvar re; \n\ttry{\n\t\tre = `${r2Common.prefixUrl}/about`;\n\t}catch(e){}\n\treturn re;\n} \n//以下配置请参照React-Router官方文档\nmodule.exports = {\n\tlayout: \"main\",//在这里设置layout\n\tpath: view(), \n    getComponent(location, cb) {\n        require.ensure([], (require) => {\n            cb(null, require(\"./index\"))\n        },\"about\")//webpack生成文件命名\n    },\n}\n```\n\n- `index.jsx`代码结构\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Component from 'r2/module/ModuleComponent'\n\nclass View extends Component {\n    constructor(props){\n        super(props);//使用了构造器,必须要super(props)继承 \n    }\n    render() {\n        super.render();//需要继承，本框架做了些处理，不继承，热替换失效。\n        return (\n            <div></div>\n        )\n    }\n}\n\nvar ReduxView = connect((state)=>{\n    return {\n    };\n})(View)\nReduxView.defaultProps = Object.assign({},Component.defaultProps,{\n    title: \"title设置处\",\n    breadcrumb:[\n        {\n            label:'home',\n            link: '/',\n        },\n        {\n            label:'导播活动列表',\n        },\n    ],\n});\nmodule.exports = ReduxView; \n```\n\n### 设置公共path\n\n假设我们的域名是localhost，平常我们都是直接访问http://localhost就看访问了页面主页。但是也有特殊要求，要在http://localhost/main访问主页，访问http://localhost也跳转到http://localhost/main(当然通过ngnix可以做些特殊处理)。这个功能就是给你设置main的。\n\n通过`r2Common.prefixUrl`（位置在`src/common/common.js`）设置，默认为空，如果不为空第一个字符必须是`/`，如\n\n```jsx\nr2Common.prefixUrl = '/main';//如果只设置为'main',访问时会报404。\n```\n\n### 设置浏览器标签title\n\nR2框架是通过react default props设置title的， 在页面index.jsx中设置如下\n\n```jsx\nReduxView.defaultProps = Object.assign({},Component.defaultProps,{\n    title: \"title设置处\",\n});\n```\n\n### layout切换\n\nlayout默认是`page/view/layout/main`，设置位置为每个view中的`_route.js`，代码如下。\n\n```jsx\n'use strict';\nvar view = function(){\n\t//这里try在浏览器中是多此一举，在智能路由中，node环境就需要,跳过异常\n\tvar re; \n\ttry{\n\t\tre = `${r2Common.prefixUrl}/about`;\n\t}catch(e){}\n\treturn re;\n} \nmodule.exports = {\n\tlayout: \"main\",//在这里设置layout\n\tpath: view(), \n    getComponent(location, cb) {\n        require.ensure([], (require) => {\n            cb(null, require(\"./index\"))\n        },\"about\")\n    },\n}\n```\n\n当设置为false时或者不设置，就没有layout。\n\n### 面包屑\n\n面包屑功能稍微特殊点，需要结合layout页面使用，目前的面包写是针对Ant Design UI做处理的。\n面包屑默认自带首页，如果需要修改可以在layout组件中的default props修改。\n\n修改layout组件默认的首页：\n\n```jsx\n//此处为layout组件\nvar ReduxView = connect((state)=>{\n\treturn {\n\t};\n})(View)\nReduxView.defaultProps = Object.assign({},Component.defaultProps,{\n\thomeLink: {\n\t\tlabel:<Antd.Icon type=\"home\"/>,\n\t\tlink:'/',\n\t},\n});\nmodule.exports = ReduxView; \n```\n\n在当前页面组件的index.jsx中设置如下：\n\n```jsx\nReduxView.defaultProps = Object.assign({},Component.defaultProps,{\n    title: \"title设置处\",\n    breadcrumb:[\n        {\n            //还支持函数\n            label:function(params){\n                //params是R2从路由参数`:id`中解析处理，以`-`为分隔符。\n                //如果当前路由为`/test/page/9_demo`,params = [9,'demo']\n                return params[1];\n            },\n            link: function(parms){\n                //同label\n                return \"test/page/\"+params[0]; \n            },\n        },\n        {\n            label:'循环存储查询',\n            link: \"/test\",\n        },\n        {\n            label:'循环存储查询',\n        },\n    ]\n});\n```\n\n**展示**需要手动在当前的layout组件中添加，位置自定义：\n\n```jsx\n<div className=\"r2-breadcrumb\">\n\t{ this.breadcrumb || \"\" }\n</div>\n```\n\n### 自定义route\n\nR2框架目标是让使用者可以不用理会路由层，不过也提供了自定义路由和覆盖已生成的路由。进入`R2/src/routes.js`,代码如下：\n\n```jsx\nimport routes from '.fr/.temp/routes'\n/**\n *   var routes = {\n *      path : \"/\",\n *      indexRoute: \"\",\n *      component: \"\",\n *      childRoutes: { }\n *  }\n */\n//如果想自定义这里也是可以的,\n//Object.assign(routes.childRoutes,{\n\n//})\nmodule.exports = routes;\n```\n\n如果不了解，请先了解[react-router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router)\n\n### 定义公共actionCreator\n\nR2框架公共actionCreator定义于`R2/src/page/action`,建议公共的actionCreator就定义在这里（当然你想定义在其他地方也可以）。commonAction代码如下\n\n```jsx\nimport * as r2ActionCreator from \"r2/actionCreator\"\n\nlet requestPosts = r2ActionCreator.requestPosts; \nlet receivePosts = r2ActionCreator.receivePosts; \nexport const REQUESTLOGOUT = \"REQUESTLOGOUT\"\nexport const RECIEVELOGOUT = \"RECIEVELOGOUT\"\n\nexport function logout(successCallback,callbackAllStatus) {\n    var url = r2Common.REQUESTURL + \"/sop/v1/operators/logout\";\n    return r2fetch({\n        method: 'POST',\n        params:{},\n        callbackAllStatus,\n        successMessage: true,\n    }).dispatchFetchOne(url,requestPosts(REQUESTLOGOUT,\"logout\"),receivePosts(RECIEVELOGOUT,\"logout\"),successCallback)\n}\n```\n\n### 定义公共reducer\n\nR2框架公共reducer定义于`R2/src/page/reducer`,建议公共的reducer就定义在这里（当然你想定义在其他地方也可以）,然后运行`npm run ac`进行reducer绑定。代码如下\n\n```jsx\nimport * as actionCreator from './action' \n\nexport function logout(state = {}, action) {\n    switch (action.type) {\n        \n        case actionCreator.REQUESTLOGOUT: \n        case actionCreator.RECIEVELOGOUT:   \n            return Object.assign({}, state,action);\n        \n        default:\n            return state;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 全局变量定义\n\n目前R2框架的全局变量如下，详细情况API。\n\n- r2fn,公共常用方法\n- r2ActionCreator,公共actionCreator\n- r2fetch,R2封装的fetch方法\n- r2Common,当前项目公共配置或方法\n\n## 国际化功能\n\n国际化语言包位置在`R2/src/common/locale`文件中，`index.js`文件是默认是当地开发中语言。配置语言位置在`R2/src/common/common.js`中，如下：\n\n```js\n//国际化处理，language未定义就是默认使用./locale/index.js\nexport const language = require(\"./locale/en_US\")\n```\n\n使用方式如下：\n\n```jsx\n...\nreturn (\n\t<div>{r2fn.t(\"主页\")}</div>\n)\n...\n```\n\n`locale/index.js`\n\n```jsx\nmodule.exports = [\n\t\"R2框架\",\n\t\"主页\",\n\t\"关于\",\n\t\"这是一个主页页面！\",\n\t\"这是一个关于页面！\",\n]\n```\n\n`locale/en_US.js`，索引位置要跟上面的一一对应，所以最好以index.js模板进行翻译，**注意空格**哦\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = [\n\t\"R2 framework\",\n\t\"Home\",\n\t\"About\",\n\t\"This is a home page!\",\n\t\"This is a  about page!\",\n]\n```\n\n## 约定位置\n\n## 其他的一些特殊模式\n\n为了更好的管理代码，R2框架建议，所有React组件继承`r2/module/BasicComponent`(layout组件式特殊的一种)。之后新的组件包括页面index.jsx组件，数据逻辑处理请全部写在方法dataAdapter中，事件处理写在events中,redux 的dispatch actionCreator写在方法actions中。代码示例如下：\n\n```jsx\nimport React from 'react'\nimport Component from 'r2/module/ModuleComponent'\nimport { connect } from 'react-redux'\n\nclass View extends Component {\n    constructor(props){\n        super(props); \n    }\n    \n    actions(){\n        return {\n            getData(){\n                this.props.dispatch(actionCreator());\n            },\n        }\n    }\n        \n    dataAdapter(){\n        return {\n            sortData(){\n                this.props.data.sort((a,b)=>{\n                    return b-a;\n                })\n            },\n        } \n    }\n    \n    events(){\n        return {\n            handleClick(text){\n                return (e)=>{\n                    console.debug(text)\n                    console.debug(e)\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    render() {\n        super.render();\n        this.sortData();\n        return (\n            <div onClick={this.handleClick(\"骚年！\")}>\n                Hello Word!\n            </div>\n        )   \n    }\n}\nmodule.exports = View; \n```\n\n定义在dataAdapter和events中的方法可以被组件`this`直接访问，R2框架内部做了处理。事件绑定也建议使用thunk模式。\n\n## 可能会遇到的坑\n\n###

    "readme": "# React通用后台\n\n目标是快速搭建一个可用的后台界面，可以先看下[DEMO(普通)](http://jiangxy.github.io/react-antd-admin) / [DEMO(TAB模式)](http://jiangxy.github.io/react-antd-admin/tabMode)，用户名/密码：guest/guest。友情提示：这个DEMO还是有点大的，加载可能稍慢，注意网速。。。\n\n也可以[点击这里](docs/Screenshot.md)查看截图，包含一些主要特性的演示。\n\n如果对React或Ant Design感兴趣，但又不知如何入手的话，也可以参考下这个项目。\n \n* [这是个啥东西](#需求背景)\n* [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n* [更新记录](CHANGELOG.md)\n* [TODO](docs/TODO.md)\n* [一些说明](#一些说明)\n* [更多文档](docs/README.md)\n\n## 需求背景\n\n其实总结下就一句话：简化后端人员的前端开发。。。\n\n虽然俺是个java开发，但总是难免要做一些前端的东西。比如各种内部系统，各种运营后台，总要有个界面给人用的吧。如果是自己用的话当然命令行就可以将就下了。。。\n\n内部系统么，公司也不会很重视，不会有专业的前端来搞。后端人员自己搞搞，能用就行了。\n\n然而每次写前端都很痛苦，无论以前用velocity+jquery+bootstrap，还是现在用React。首先有很多重复的工作，很多后台界面其实都长得差不多；其次有时会为一些很小的需求投入很大精力，写很多业务逻辑，但这些代码都是不可复用的，感觉花这么多时间不值得，毕竟不是本职工作啊，只是个二手前端。。。甚至有时折腾css就能搞一天。。。\n\n于是就想着能否一劳永逸，搞个比较通用的东西出来，**尽量用写配置的方式替代写代码**。从某种角度上说，和[Metronic](http://keenthemes.com/preview/metronic/)/[AdminLTE](https://almsaeedstudio.com/preview)的目标有点相似。正好前段时间在研究[Ant Design](http://ant.design)，做了一些尝试，于是有了这个项目。当然并不完美，对于React和Ant Design，我也是边学边用的。\n\n首先看下，常见的后台系统都是什么样子的？\n\n![](docs/overview.png)\n\n是不是大部分后端系统的界面都差不多这个样子？分为几个主要的部分：\n\n* 侧边栏：上面是一个logo，下面是可展开的各级菜单。点击菜单项时，右边会展示相应的内容。\n* Header：展示当前登录的用户名和面包屑导航，还可能有自定义的一些菜单之类\n* 内容区：展示具体的内容，跟业务有关的\n* Footer：展示copyright之类的\n* 还有些看不到的，比如登录、注销等\n\n于是我做的**第一件事**，就是搭建一个框架，用配置文件的方式，生成这样一个界面。你可以定义自己的侧边栏（参考[src/menu.js](src/menu.js)），定义点击侧边栏菜单时在右边渲染什么组件（参考[src/index.js](src/index.js)，其实就是React Router的配置），包括header/footer/登录校验/单点登录等，都可以配置（参考[src/config.js](src/config.js)）。\n\n在此基础上，我只要根据不同的后台系统的业务逻辑，去写不同的React组件，再配置下菜单就可以了。貌似简化很多了。缺点就是所有后台都长一个样子。。。\n\n但能否更简化些呢？在各种运营后台中，最常见的操作是什么？我的感觉，最常见的就是各种数据库表的CRUD。我们经常赋予数据库字段各种业务意义。比如将某条记录的status字段改为-1，表示屏蔽这个商品；或者新增一个商品，其实就是某个表新增一条记录之类的。运营的很多操作，是不是都能简化成CRUD？于是我又做了**第二件事**：写了一个通用的CRUD组件，我称之为DBTable。大概长这个样子：\n\n![](docs/DBTable.png)\n\n也是分为几个部分：\n\n* 查询条件区：其实就是个表单，所有表单项都是由配置文件生成的（参考[src/schema/test.querySchema.js](src/schema/test.querySchema.js)），支持各种数据类型\n* 各种操作：提供常用的CRUD/导入/导出等操作\n* 查询结果展示：就是一个表格，这个表格的schema也是可配置的（参考[src/schema/test.dataSchema.js](src/schema/test.dataSchema.js)）\n* 针对单条数据的操作：也是可配置的（参考[src/schema/testAction.dataSchema.js](src/schema/testAction.dataSchema.js#L52)）\n\n另外提醒下，1.4.0版本之后，querySchema和dataSchema不一定要用js文件配置了，可以从服务端异步加载了，参考[异步schema相关配置](docs/AsyncSchema.md)。\n\n使用者只用关心自己的schema文件就可以了，不用在意渲染出来是什么样子。利用DBTable组件，就可以快速实现对某个表的CRUD了（其实不只可以用于数据库，符合这种操作模式的都可以用）。缺点就是没有了明确的业务含义，运营MM们可能不会用。。。她们又不知道CRUD是啥。所以需要培训下，但也是套近乎的好机会啊😄。\n\n但是且慢，只有界面是不够的，**如何跟后端对接**？于是我又定义了[后端接口格式](docs/Ajax.md)。只要按这个格式去写后端接口，就可以跟这套通用后台无缝对接。如果你跟我一样是个懒人，而且恰巧是用java的，又恰巧后端是基于Spring的，那也可以使用我提供的一个[小工具](https://github.com/jiangxy/react-java-goos)直接生成后端接口，然后填写自己的业务逻辑就可以了。\n\n使用这套工具，如果一切顺利的话，你能很快的搭出一个后台界面，包含基础的登录/菜单/导航/CRUD/导入/导出等功能，并且界面&体验也还算看得过去，不用任何编码，只是修改配置。\n\n我尽量做到**配置优于代码**，尽量少写代码。但完全不写代码是不可能的，尤其是有个性化需求时，这就要自己权衡了。这套工具比较适合项目初期做个原型、或者对后台要求不高的情况。\n\n## Quick Start\n\n在自己的机器上调试：\n\n1. 保证node版本5.3+，npm版本3.3+\n2. clone下来后，`npm install`，安装必要的依赖\n3. `npm run dev`，启动webpack-dev-server，打开浏览器`http://localhost:8080`查看效果。默认是debug模式，不会请求后端接口，所有数据都是mock的，相关配置见[src/config.js](src/config.js)\n4. 如果有必要的话可以把logLevel设置为debug（见[src/config.js](src/config.js)），会输出详细的debug日志，打开chrome的console就可以看到。\n\n用在自己的项目中：\n\n1. 保证node版本5.3+，npm版本3.3+\n2. clone下来后，`npm install`，安装必要的依赖\n3. 参考[src/menu.js](src/menu.js)，按自己的需要配置侧边栏和顶部菜单\n4. 修改[src/index.js](src/index.js)中的路由表，保证和menu.js中的菜单项一致，否则可能404\n5. 如果要用DBTable组件的话，参考[src/schema](src/schema)下的例子，编写自己的querySchema和dataSchema文件。在路由表中配置DBTable组件时，要把表名作为props传入，类似`<Route path=\"option1\" tableName=\"test\" component={DBTable}/>`。\n6. 修改[src/config.js](src/config.js)中相关配置，比如项目名、footer、单点登录等等。\n7. `npm run prod`，编译js文件，然后将dist目录下的所有js/css/html文件拷贝到自己的工程中，前端的工作就完成了。一般会有一个index.html，一个bundle.min.css，以及多个js文件，跟是否使用动态路由有关。\n8. 开发后端接口，接口规范见[这里](docs/Ajax.md)。如果是java后端，可以使用[这个工具](https://github.com/jiangxy/react-java-goos)帮你生成。\n9. 启动你的web服务，访问`index.html`查看效果。\n\n其他一些命令:\n\n1. `npm run eslint`/`npm run stylelint`/`npm run lesshint`，一些lint工具。\n2. `npm run clean`，删除dist目录下的bundle*.js。\n\n## 一些说明\n\n### 安全/权限问题\n\n目前对安全&权限都没考虑进去，如果有这方面的要求，只能后端校验了。在请求后端接口时校验用户的身份和权限。\n\n权限问题也很麻烦，感觉不太好做成通用的东西，如果有需求的话，还是定制开发比较好。\n \n### 兼容性\n\n能力所限，只能保证chrome中正常使用。。。话说在各种内部系统中，要求只能用chrome也挺常见吧。\n\n如果我解决了兼容性问题，就不是二手前端了。。。\n\n另外由于我是在mac下进行开发的，所以对windows下的情况测试的比较少，有问题欢迎提issue，我尽力解决。\n\n### bundle size\n\n单页应用的首屏渲染一直都是个大问题。webpack打包出来的bundle.js一般都很大，虽然我想了很多办法去优化，但总是还会有1M多，实在减不下去了。。。所以应用到外网时要小心，初次加载时可能比较慢。\n\n内网的话就无所谓了，一般网速都不是问题。\n",

    "readme": "# react-antd-dva\n\n基于react + ant-design + dva + Mock 企业级后台管理系统最佳实践\n\n## 特性\n\n- :gem: **优雅美观**：基于 Ant Design 体系精心设计\n- :rocket: **最新技术栈**：使用 React/dva/antd 等前端前沿技术开发\n- :1234: **Mock 数据**：实用的本地数据调试方案\n\n## 模板\n\n- [x] 项目搭建\n- [x] 登录\n- [ ] 主页\n\n## 使用\n\n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/sosout/react-antd-dva.git\n$ cd react-antd-dva\n$ npm install\n$ npm start         # 访问 http://localhost:8888\n```\n\n## 兼容性\n\n现代浏览器及 IE11。\n\n\n## dva用法\n\n### dynamic\n\n解决组件动态加载问题的 util 方法，基于 react-async-component 实现。比如：\n\n```javascript\nimport dynamic from 'dva-react-router-3/dynamic';\n\nconst UserPageComponent = dynamic({\n  app,\n  models: () => [\n    import('./models/users'),\n  ],\n  component: () => import('./routes/UserPage'),\n});\n```\n\n## react-router 4.0\n\n### exact（boolean类型）\n\n如果为 true, 则仅在位置完全匹配时才应用。\n\n```javascript\npath\tlocation.pathname\texact\tmatches?\n/one\t/one/two\t        true\tno\n/one\t/one/two\t        false\tyes\n```\n\n## React PureComponent\n\n### 为什么使用？\n\nReact15.3中新加了一个 PureComponent 类，顾名思义， pure 是纯的意思， PureComponent 也就是纯组件，取代其前身 PureRenderMixin , PureComponent 是优化 React 应用程序最重要的方法之一，易于实施，只要把继承类从 Component 换成 PureComponent 即可，可以减少不必要的 render 操作的次数，从而提高性能，而且可以少写 shouldComponentUpdate 函数，节省了点代码。\n\n### 原理\n\n当组件更新时，如果组件的 props 和 state 都没发生改变， render 方法就不会触发，省去 Virtual DOM 的生成和比对过程，达到提升性能的目的。具体就是 React 自动帮我们做了一层浅比较：\n\n```javascript\nif (this._compositeType === CompositeTypes.PureClass) {\n  shouldUpdate = !shallowEqual(prevProps, nextProps)\n  || !shallowEqual(inst.state, nextState);\n}\n````\n\n而 shallowEqual 又做了什么呢？会比较 Object.keys(state | props) 的长度是否一致，每一个 key 是否两者都有，并且是否是一个引用，也就是只比较了第一层的值，确实很浅，所以深层的嵌套数据是对比不出来的。\n\n### 使用指南\n\n#### 易变数据不能使用一个引用\n\n示例：\n\n```javascript\nclass App extends PureComponent {\n  state = {\n    items: [1, 2, 3]\n  }\n  handleClick = () => {\n    const { items } = this.state;\n    items.pop();\n    this.setState({ items });\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (<div>\n      <ul>\n        {this.state.items.map(i => <li key={i}>{i}</li>)}\n      </ul>\n      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>delete</button>\n    </div>)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n会发现，无论怎么点 delete 按钮， li 都不会变少，因为 items 用的是一个引用， shallowEqual 的结果为 true 。改正：\n\n```javascript\nhandleClick = () => {\n  const { items } = this.state;\n  items.pop();\n  this.setState({ items: [].concat(items) });\n}\n```\n\n这样每次改变都会产生一个新的数组，也就可以 render 了。这里有一个矛盾的地方，如果没有 items.pop(); 操作，每次 items 数据并没有变，但还是 render 了，这不就很操蛋么？呵呵，数据都不变，你 setState 干嘛？\n\n#### 不变数据使用一个引用\n\n##### 子组件数据\n\n上面易变数据不能使用一个引用的案例中有一个点击删除操作，如果我们删除的代码这么写：\n\n```javascript\nhandleClick = () => {\n  const { items } = this.state;\n  items.splice(items.length - 1, 1);\n  this.setState({ items });\n}\n```\n\nitems 的引用也是改变的，但如果 items 里面是引用类型数据：\n\n```javascript\nitems: [{a: 1}, {a: 2}, {a: 3}]\n```\n\n这个时候\n\n```javascript\nstate.items[0] === nextState.items[0] // false\n```\n\n子组件里还是re-render了。这样就需要我们保证不变的子组件数据的引用不能改变。这个时候可以使用immutable-js函数库。\n\n##### 函数属性\n\n我们在给组件传一个函数的时候，有时候总喜欢:\n\n```javascript\n// 1\n<MyInput onChange={e => this.props.update(e.target.value)} />\n// 2\nupdate(e) {\n  this.props.update(e.target.value)\n}\nrender() {\n  return <MyInput onChange={this.update.bind(this)} />\n}\n```\n\n由于每次 render 操作 MyInput 组件的 onChange 属性都会返回一个新的函数，由于引用不一样，所以父组件的 render 也会导致 MyInput 组件的 render ，即使没有任何改动，所以需要尽量避免这样的写法，最好这样写：\n\n```javascript\n// 1,2\nupdate = (e) => {\n  this.props.update(e.target.value)\n}\nrender() {\n  return <MyInput onChange={this.update} />\n}\n```\n\n##### 空对象、空数组或固定对象\n\n有时候后台返回的数据中，数组长度为0或者对象没有属性会直接给一个 null ，这时候我们需要做一些容错：\n\n```javascript\nclass App extends PureComponent {\n  state = {\n    items: [{ name: 'test1' }, null, { name: 'test3'  }]\n  }\n  store = (id, value) => {\n    const { items } = this.state;\n    items[id]  = assign({}, items[id], { name: value });\n    this.setState({ items: [].concat(items) });\n  }\n  render() {\n    return (<div>\n      <ul>\n        {this.state.items.map((i, k) =>\n          <Item style={{ color: 'red' }} store={this.store} key={k} id={k} data={i || {}} />)\n        }\n      </ul>\n    </div>)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n当某一个子组件调用 store 函数改变了自己的那条属性，触发 render 操作，如果数据是 null 的话 data 属性每次都是一个 {}，{} ==== {} 是 false 的，这样无端的让这几个子组件重新 render 了。{ color: 'red' }也是一样。\n\n最好设置一个 defaultValue 为 {},如下：\n\n```javascript\nstatic defaultValue = {}\nconst style = { color: 'red' };\n<Item style={style} store={this.store} key={k} id={k} data={i || defaultValue} />\n```\n\n### 复杂状态与简单状态不要共用一个组件\n\n这点可能和 PureComponent 没多少关系，但做的不好可能会浪费很多性能，比如一个页面上面一部分是一个复杂的列表，下面是一个输入框，抽象代码：\n\n```javascript\nchange = (e) => {\n  this.setState({ value: e.target.value });\n}\nrender() {\n  return (<div>\n    <ul>\n      {this.state.items.map((i, k) => <li key={k}> {...}</li>)}\n    </ul>\n    <input value={this.state.value} onChange={this.change} />\n  </div>)\n}\n```\n\n表单和列表其实是没有什么关联的，表单的值也可能经常变动，但它的会给列表也带来必然的 diff 操作，这是没必要的，最好是给列表抽出成一个单独的 PureComponent 组件，这样 state.items 不变的话，列表就不会重新 render 了。\n\n### 与 shouldComponentUpdate 共存\n\n如果 PureComponent 里有 shouldComponentUpdate 函数的话，直接使用 shouldComponentUpdate 的结果作为是否更新的依据，没有 shouldComponentUpdate 函数的话，才会去判断是不是 PureComponent ，是的话再去做 shallowEqual 浅比较。\n\n```javascript\n// 这个变量用来控制组件是否需要更新\nvar shouldUpdate = true;\n// inst 是组件实例\nif (inst.shouldComponentUpdate) {\n  shouldUpdate = inst.shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState, nextContext);\n} else {\n  if (this._compositeType === CompositeType.PureClass) {\n    shouldUpdate = !shallowEqual(prevProps, nextProps) ||\n      !shallowEqual(inst.state, nextState);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 老版本兼容写法\n\n```javascript\nimport React { PureComponent, Component } from 'react';\nclass Foo extends (PureComponent || Component) {\n  //...\n}\n```\n\n这样在老版本的 React 里也不会挂掉。\n\n### 总结\n\nPureComponent 真正起作用的，只是在一些纯展示组件上，复杂组件用了也没关系，反正 shallowEqual 那一关就过不了，不过记得 props 和 state 不能使用同一个引用哦。\n",

 // or 'antd/dist/antd.less'\nimport { DatePicker } from 'antd';\nReactDOM.render(<DatePicker />, mountNode);  //也可传入参数\n```\n如果只需要用到其中的几个组件，则引入全部antd的样式则会显得多余，官方文档推荐了一个package： `babel-plugin-import`，配置使用后只需引入组件就行，不用理会样式，`babel-plugin-import`会自动按需加载需要的样式，而忽略那些多余的样式\n```javascript\n// babel-plugin-import 会帮助你加载 JS 和 CSS\nimport { DatePicker } from 'antd';\n```\n## React + Es6\n> 用es6的语法写react组件会有一些不同，比如。。\n\n#### 组件的定义\n* es5语法：\n  ```javascript\n  var Component = React.createClass({\n    render: function() {\n      return <h1>Hello World</h1>;\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n* es6语法：\n  ```javascript\n  class Component extends React.Component {\n    render() {\n      return (\n        <h1>Hello World</h1>\n      );\n    }\n  };\n  ```\n\n#### 定义组件的state属性\n* es5语法：\n  ```javascript\n  var Component = React.createClass({\n    getInitialState: function() {\n      return {text: 'World'};\n    },\n    render: function() {\n      return <h1>Hello {this.state.text}</h1>;\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n* es6语法：\n  ```javascript\n  class Component extends React.Component {\n    constructor() {\n      super(); //子类没有自己的this对象，而是继承父类的this对象，然后对其进行加工。如果不调用super方法，子类就得不到this对象。\n  \tthis.state = {text: 'World'};\n    }\n    render() {\n      return (\n        <h1>Hello {this.state.text}</h1>\n      );\n    }\n  };\n  ```\n#### 组件事件处理函数的this差异\n* es5语法：\n  ```javascript\n  var Component = React.createClass({\n    getInitialState: function() {\n      return {text: 'World'};\n    },\n    handleClick: function() {\n      this.setState({text: 'React'});\n    },\n    render: function() {\n      return <h1 onClick={this.handleClick}>Hello {this.state.text}</h1>;\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n  用es5写法时，在事件处理函数handleClick中，this指向的是组件本身，所以this有setState方法。\n\n* es6语法：\n  ```javascript\n  class Component extends React.Component {\n    constructor() {\n      super(); //子类没有自己的this对象，而是继承父类的this对象，然后对其进行加工。如果不调用super方法，子类就得不到this对象。\n  \tthis.state = {text: 'World'};\n    }\n\n    handleClick() {\n      this.setState({text: 'React'});\n    }\n\n    render() {\n      return (\n        <h1 onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this)}>Hello {this.state.text}</h1>\n      );\n    }\n  };\n  ```\n  使用es6语法时，如果绑定事件时直接用`<h1 onClick={this.handleClick}>`,则函数handleClick里的this为`null`,调用`this.setState`方法时会报错，所以需改为`<h1 onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this)}>`,用当前组件对象替换之前的`null`，成为新的this\n\n\n\n## 一些相关链接\n* [HTML to JSX Compiler](http://magic.reactjs.net/htmltojsx.htm) ：可将html代码转换成jsx形式\n\n* [ANT DESIGN - 一个ui设计语言](https://ant.design/index-cn)\n\n* [React 中文文档](https://tianxiangbing.github.io/react-cn/docs/getting-started.html)\n\n* [webpack 2.2 中文文档](http://www.css88.com/doc/webpack2/)\n\n* [前端编码规范](https://giscafer.gitbooks.io/front-end-manual/content/) ：算是比较详细的，包含编码规范和优化等\n\n* [阮一峰的react入门](http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2015/03/react.html) ：简单易懂，配套demo，适合初学者入门\n\n* [阮一峰的es6入门](http://es6.ruanyifeng.com/)\n\n* [入门Webpack，看这篇就够了](http://www.jianshu.com/p/42e11515c10f#) ：写的很不错，逐级深入，有点长，耐心看完\n\n## 后记\n总结了项目中遇到的一些问题和用到的东西，前端这条路还很长，我也会不断的学习更多新知识，如果有写的不对，不好的地方，虚心接受大家的指点~\n",

   // 默认主题\r\n// import '../static/css/theme-green/index.css';       // 浅绿色主题\r\n```\r\n\r\n第二步：打开 src/App.vue 文件，找到 style 标签引入样式的地方，切换成浅绿色主题。\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n@import \"../static/css/main.css\";\r\n@import \"../static/css/color-dark.css\";     /*深色主题*/\r\n/*@import \"../static/css/theme-green/color-green.css\";   !*浅绿色主题*!*/\r\n```\r\n\r\n第三步：打开 src/components/common/Sidebar.vue 文件，找到 el-menu 标签，把 theme=\"dark\" 去掉即可。\r\n\r\n## 项目截图 ##\r\n### 默认皮肤 ###\r\n\r\n![Image text](https://github.com/lin-xin/manage-system/raw/master/screenshots/wms1.png)\r\n\r\n### 浅绿色皮肤 ###\r\n\r\n![Image text](https://github.com/lin-xin/manage-system/raw/master/screenshots/wms2.png)",
