  ## Concept


  ![flowchart](./docs/flowchart.png)


  As we find out html are mostly same in react projects, we extract the same
  html into a template file which lays in `html` folder.


  `html-webpack-plugin` is used to generate released html files, which load
  corresponding js files.


  `entries` stores js main methods, we split main container to `containers`
  because entry could not be hot-module-replaced.


  `entries`s import `containers`s, which is one to one correspondent. `render`
  method in entry provides all commonly used setups, such as redux store,
  provider, injectTapEventPlugin for material-ui, and custom styles.


  `containers` is the headquarters which imports all dummy components, passing
  through props to them. Also, `containers` interacts with redux `reducers` and
  `actions`.


  It is recommended that you wrap containers into another. `redux` will
  re-render a container when and only when mapped reducers have been updated.


  We do not use async redux for ajax requests because ajax status is not that
  important for us to record. So, we invoke `api` in `containers`, get response,
  and determine what `actions` to call.


  We store every string in `i18n` for better internationalization.


  Built project files will be in the `release` folder. With `build.log`, you can
  see every build details. With `stats.html`, you can optimize your dependencies
  to make project smaller.
